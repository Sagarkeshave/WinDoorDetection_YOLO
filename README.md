# üèóÔ∏è YOLOv8 Object Detection App ‚Äì Blueprint Door & Window Detector

Welcome to my deployed computer vision project using **YOLOv8 + Gradio**, designed to detect **doors and windows** in architectural **construction blueprints**.

![demo](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/raw/main/yolov8/banner-yolov8.png)

---

## üîç About the App

This application showcases a deep learning model trained on blueprint images to identify:
- üö™ **Doors**
- ü™ü **Windows**

The goal was to automate detection in architectural layouts and assist with digitizing or verifying blueprint components.

---

## üí° How it Works

- The app is powered by a **custom-trained YOLOv8** model.
- You can **upload a blueprint image** via the Gradio interface.
- The model will return:
  - ‚úÖ An **annotated image** showing detections
  - ‚úÖ A **JSON output** with detection details in this format:

```json
{
  "detections": [
    {"label": "door", "confidence": 0.91, "bbox": [x, y, w, h]},
    {"label": "window", "confidence": 0.84, "bbox": [x, y, w, h]}
  ]
}
```

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Upload a construction blueprint image.
2. View the image with annotated bounding boxes.
3. Review the detection results in JSON format.

‚úÖ Try it online: *(add your Hugging Face space URL here)*  
‚úÖ Or run it locally:

```bash
git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/yolov8-gradio-demo
cd yolov8-gradio-demo
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
